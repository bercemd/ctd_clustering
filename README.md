# CTD Clustering
## Clustering of RNA Polymerase II C-Terminal Domain Models using MD simulations
This repository contains the scripts for the analysis of the simulations of concentrated 2CTD (CTD with 2-heptapeptide repeats) non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated systems. It also contains extracted representative frames with the lowest energy conformations according to the PCA of the cartesian coordinates of the peptides along the simulation trajectories.
